This helps to resolve\neditor and project options. `tokamak.toml` file will be used by helper in the future.\nIt should resides in with same level of `Cargo.toml`.\nBy default Cargo project generated with tokamak will create it also.\nHere is an example `tokamak.toml` file.\n\n```\n[helper]\npath = \"\"                                  # Reserved for future helper path and configurations\n[options]\nsave_buffers_before_run = true             # Saving buffers before every cargo command run\ngeneral_warnings = true                    # Show general warnings\n[project]\nauto_format_timing = 5                     # Run auto formatting for project for specified interval (seconds)\n```\n\n## Contributing\nContribution rules are written in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/vertexclique/tokamak/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Mahmut Bulut\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
