Although Ink is in an early state, people interested in\ngetting it running with other languages are welcome to reach out.\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/full.gif\" /></div>\n\n### Highlights\n\n*(These demos show off Ink as part of [Julia](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client)\nsince it's the most mature project using Ink, but there's nothing Julia-specific about\nInk's design)*\n\nEvaluation of blocks and lines, with inline results, highlighting of the evaluated block,\nand loading indicators:\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/eval.gif\" /></div>\n\nSmart tree views for complex results and data:\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/tree.gif\" /></div>\n\nA rich console with the same support for results, as well as history, shell modes etc.:\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/console.gif\" /></div>\n\nSmart errors with live links to files in the backtrace, as well as highlighting of those\nlines:\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/master/demos/errors.gif\" /></div>\n\nIn future Ink will also support UIs for debugging (e.g. breakpoints), graphics (e.g. plotting panes), documentation (e.g. single-keystroke access to inline docs) and profiling/coverage results (e.g. inline \"progress bars\" and metrics overlaid with the code).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-ink#readme","_id":"ink@0.5.0","_shasum":"d63cfe83f42acdc59fcc00d1b93b6e89905c76bc","_resolved":"file:../d-116718-77555-su6j6u/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116718-77555-su6j6u/package.tgz"}
