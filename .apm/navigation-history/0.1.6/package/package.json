This helps keep the cursor history more useful by ignoring small navigations near the cursor like when using the arrow keys, home, end and typing new input.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Tyriar/navigation-history/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Tyriar/navigation-history#readme","_id":"navigation-history@0.1.6","_shasum":"99cc95fb5e0e9898f132d2194f48fdab93fa0b47","_resolved":"file:../d-115103-17471-1d0dxgo/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115103-17471-1d0dxgo/package.tgz"}
