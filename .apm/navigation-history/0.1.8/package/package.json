This helps keep the cursor history more useful by ignoring small navigations near the cursor like when using the arrow keys, home, end and typing new input.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/Tyriar/navigation-history/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/Tyriar/navigation-history#readme","_id":"navigation-history@0.1.8","_shasum":"9574be8ab103fb5d7a55c722cd8de79bf1c94362","_resolved":"file:../d-1151013-84038-z8m089/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151013-84038-z8m089/package.tgz"}
