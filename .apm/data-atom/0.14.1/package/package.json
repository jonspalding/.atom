It supports autocomplete and exploring database information (tables, columns, views, etc.). The plan is to build it out with more data management functionality.\n\nFeel free to open issues or make pull requests!\n\n![A screenshot of your spankin' package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)\n\n##Features\n- Supports\n  - PostgreSQL\n  - MS SQL Server\n- Execute custom queries or a whole file\n  - Separate results for each file/editor view\n  - Different connections per editor view\n- Autocomplete for table and column names\n- Easily change the database/connection to execute against\n- View meta information (tables, columns, views, etc.) for the connected database\n- Check the execution time in the right of the status bar\n- Save connections for easily connecting later\n\n##Usage\n- `F5` or 'Data Atom: Execute' command\n  - Executes the current query source (see below) against the current connection. It will prompt if there is no current connection\n  - Only executes the selected text if there is any\n- `CMD`+`ALT`+`R` (Mac), `ALT`+`SHIFT`+`R` (Windows, Linux) or the 'Data Atom: Toggle Results View' command\n  - Toggle results view\n- `ALT`+`SHIFT`+`D` or the 'Data Atom: Toggle Details View' command\n  - Toggle the database details view, showing table, column, view, etc. information\n\n###Other commands\n- 'Data Atom: Toggle Query Source' or the button right of 'Execute' on the toolbar\n  - Toggle the source of the query to execute between the active editor content and Data Atom's own query editor\n  - Allows you to easily work with SQL files in the main editor or quickly execute queries while working in any file type\n- 'Data Atom: New Query'\n  - Switch to use Data Atom's query input and focus to the keyboard there\n- 'Data Atom: New Connection'\n  - Launch the new connection dialog to add a new connection\n- 'Data Atom: Toggle Query Source'\n  - Toggle the source of the query between the active editor content (or selection) and Data Atom's own query input\n- 'Data Atom: Edit Connections'\n  - Open the saved connections file for editing\n\n##The Random TODO list\n- Replace grid with something better to allow row selection, column selection etc.\n- Manage saved connections\n- Add support for other database systems - looking for PRs for these as I do not currently use them\n  - MySql\n  - Mongo DB\n  - Oracle\n  - others?\n- More database information and visualisation e.g.\n  - Exploring relations, views, etc.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lukemurray/data-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/lukemurray/data-atom#readme","_id":"data-atom@0.14.1","_shasum":"72944b5642da21d586ca9c32e2c494cb862de4cf","_resolved":"file:../d-1151010-88300-g232tb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151010-88300-g232tb/package.tgz"}
