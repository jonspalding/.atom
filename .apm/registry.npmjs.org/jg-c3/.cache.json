It is **not** a catch-all support forum. **For general support enquiries, please use the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js) at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js.** All questions involving the interplay between C3.js and any other library (such as AngularJS) should be posted there first!\n\nBefore reporting an issue, please do the following:\n\n1. [Search for existing issues](https://github.com/masayuki0812/c3/issues) to ensure you're not posting a duplicate.\n\n1.  [Search the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/c3js) to ensure it hasn't been addressed there already.\n\n1. Create a JSFiddle or Plunkr highlighting the issue. Please don't include any unnecessary dependencies so we can isolate that the issue is in fact with C3. *Please be advised that custom CSS can modify C3.js output!*\n\n1. When posting the issue, please use a descriptive title and include the version of C3 (or, if cloning from Git, the commit hash â€” C3 is under active development and the master branch contains the latest dev commits!), along with any platform/browser/OS information that may be relevant.\n\n## Pull requests\nPull requests are welcome, though please post an issue first to see whether such a change is desirable.\nIf you choose to submit a pull request, please do not bump the version number unless asked to, and please include test cases for any new features. Squash all your commits as well, please.\n\n## Playground\nPlease fork this fiddle:\n+ [http://jsfiddle.net/masayuki0812/7kYJu/](http://jsfiddle.net/masayuki0812/7kYJu/)\n\n## Dependency\n+ [D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) `~3.5.0`\n\n## License\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"jasongilman","email":"jason.gilman@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-03-01T00:16:29.827Z","created":"2016-03-01T00:16:29.827Z","0.4.11-rc4-2":"2016-03-01T00:16:29.827Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jgilman/c3#readme","keywords":["d3","chart","graph"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/jgilman/c3.git"},"author":{"name":"Masayuki Tanaka"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jgilman/c3/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"23U47SXVXJKENXGKI1KKJAN7C\""}
