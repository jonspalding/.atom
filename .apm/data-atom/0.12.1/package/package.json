The plan is to build it out with more data management support.\n\nNote: This is an early version... Feel free to open issues or make pull requests!\n\n![A screenshot of your spankin' package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif)\n\n##Features\n- Supports\n  - PostgreSQL\n  - MS SQL Server\n- See query results below the executed query\n  - Separate results for each file\n  - Different connections per editor view\n- Easily change the database to execute against\n- Save connections for easily connecting later\n  - Run command \"Data Atom: Edit Connections\" see below for example format\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    name: 'local postgresql'\n    protocol: 'postgresql'\n    user: 'luke'\n    password: 'pass'\n    server: 'localhost'\n    database: 'mydb'\n  }\n]\n```\n\n##Usage\n- `F5` or 'Data Atom: Execute' command\n  - Executes the current editor against the current connection.
